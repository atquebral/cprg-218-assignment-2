      <p id="description">I had just finished the Sex and the City series, and I have many bones to pick with the show, plot-wise. Let’s start with the good. The best characters? Charlotte, Samantha, Aiden, and Steve. Now the ugly: Mr. Big, Miranda (she’s more of a meh in my opinion), and of course, the biggest disappointment of the entire show, the main character herself—Carrie Bradshaw. Terrible choices, terrible personality, and terrible morals. Her only saving grace? Her OUTFITS.  As the most insufferable character in the entire series, naturally, Carrie’s most redeeming quality is her wardrobe. While most people stay tuned into the show because everyone loves watching a good train wreck (myself included), Carrie’s ensembles help us *almost* forget the string of bad decisions this terrible NYC columnist makes each episode. Here’s a compilation of Carrie Bradshaw’s best outfits from each season. .</p>
